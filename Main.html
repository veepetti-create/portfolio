            <h2>About Me</h2>
            Hi! I’m Veronica, a 5th-year Human Centered Computing major at Rochester Institute of Technology. I am passionate about user design and accessibility in technology. Throughout my studies, I have had the opportunity to collaborate extensively with peers, gaining new skills and diverse perspectives. My experiences at college and in life have taught me that there isn't just one way to reach the right solution and you should always be learning something new.

    <h4>University News Re-Skin</h4>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <p>This project was to re-skin of the part of the RIT website called University News for my New Media Design Elements 2 class, where the focus of the class was for visual communication for static and interactive media. There was a strong focus on spacing, proportions and designing a wire-frame that fit what we thought that we thought our personas we made would want, which I choose to focus on RIT students, parents, and potential students.</p>

The top section features a large banner photo of students working on a project in a modern campus building, with the headline 'RIT climbs to No. 91 nationally in ‘U.S. News’ best colleges ranking.' Below that are sections titled 'News,' 'Photo Spotlight,' and 'Sports.'

The Photo Spotlight includes various campus life and event photos. The Sports section highlights upcoming women’s hockey games, volleyball wins, and Kailey Favro earning Rookie of the Week honors. The footer includes contact details for RIT and links to various institutional pages like Admissions, Athletics, and Student Life.">

                <p>This project was a class lab for New Media Design Digital Design 2 where we were to redesign the menu in a list of local Rochester businesses and I chose Balsam Bagels. This was a 2 part project where at first we made the logo and then we designed a menu to include the logo we made. This project had a focus on how to include our logo in our menu and how to use text fonts and spacing.</p>
