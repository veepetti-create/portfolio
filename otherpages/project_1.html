The top section features a large banner photo of students working on a project in a modern campus building, with the headline 'RIT climbs to No. 91 nationally in ‘U.S. News’ best colleges ranking.' Below that are sections titled 'News,' 'Photo Spotlight,' and 'Sports.' News articles cover a campus fire incident, retirement of NTID President Gerard Buckley, a national conference on research collaboration, and new AI research by an RIT professor. The Photo Spotlight includes various campus life and event photos. The Sports section highlights upcoming women’s hockey games, volleyball wins, and Kailey Favro earning Rookie of the Week honors. The footer includes contact details for RIT and links to various institutional pages like Admissions, Athletics, and Student Life.">

                <p>This design is an updated version of the one I originally submitted for class, as I knew there was room for improvement. I adjusted the spacing, refined the page content, and repositioned images to create a more visually organized layout. In earlier iterations, the larger gaps between sections made the page feel somewhat disconnected, so I focused on tightening the layout to achieve better visual flow. This project made me think more critically about how I approach website design and reminded me of the saying “less is more.” For much of the process, I was trying to include more content than was necessary, but since my professor encouraged us to modify the content freely, I took that opportunity to simplify and focus on what mattered most.</p>

                <img style="width: 80%;" src="../images/redesign_sketch_1.png" alt="A hand-drawn wireframe of a website layout. At the top, a large rectangular section labeled 'Image' is positioned next to a smaller box labeled 'info' with 'news,'' 'search,' and 'links' noted beside it. Below this are two horizontal content blocks: the first is labeled 'other events' with stacked rectangular sections, and the second is labeled 'sports' with a similar stacked layout. A small icon resembling an upward arrow is labeled “go up,” suggesting a scroll-to-top button. At the bottom, there is a 'Footer' area with a note 'other,'' indicating additional information or links.">

                <img style="width: 80%;" src="../images/redesign_sketch_2.png" alt="A sketched layout for a news-based webpage. The top section includes a header area labeled 'logo, header, topics, date' with a search icon. Below it, a large 'image news' section is accompanied by a narrow 'text news' column on the left. The next row contains multiple rectangles labeled “other news.” A separating line divides this from a grid layout featuring boxes labeled “event” and “sport” arranged in two rows. At the bottom, there's a footer section labeled 'footer/search?.'">
            </div>
            <p>My focus during the sketching phase was to ensure that information could be easily viewed and that each section was understandable without relying on heavy visual separation. Since there was a large amount of content to include, I used the sketches to explore how much information should be represented and how to balance clarity with layout density.</p>

            <h3>Iteration</h3>
            <div class="column">
                <img style="width: 70%;" src="../images/redesign_iteration1.jpg" alt="An image of a design made for the Rochester Institute of Technology University News webpage. The top section features a large banner photo of two students working on mechanical parts in a bright, modern campus building, with the headline “RIT climbs to No. 91 nationally in ‘U.S. News’ best colleges ranking.” Below the banner are sections titled “News,” “Events,” “Sports,” and “Campus Spotlight.” The News section highlights a story about an RIT graduate opening a music studio and smaller articles about mural art and prosthetics research. The Events section lists a Coffee Chat on November 4th and a Voter Celebration Table on October 29th. The Sports section showcases women’s hockey and volleyball games, as well as Kailey Favro and Sophia Bellina receiving AHA honors. The Campus Spotlight displays photos of students and campus scenes. The footer contains RIT contact information and links to pages for Admissions, Research, and Student Life.">

The top section features the same banner photo of two students working on a project in a modern academic space, with the headline “RIT climbs to No. 91 nationally in ‘U.S. News’ best colleges ranking.” Below that, the layout displays sections titled “News,” “Events,” “Sports,” and “Photo Spotlight.” The News section includes stories about RIT President David Munson being recognized by the Rochester Business Journal, NTID President Gerard Buckley’s retirement, a campus incident report, research collaborations, and advances in artificial intelligence. The Events section highlights campus programs such as RIT FoodShare, Bern’s Closet Shopping, a pajama movie night, and a plant sale. The Sports section covers men’s and women’s hockey, volleyball, and basketball games, with a sidebar showing recent game scores. The Photo Spotlight features campus life and lab images. The footer lists RIT’s address, contact number, and institutional links.">

            <p>When I first began working on my designs, I experimented with different groupings and text arrangements. In these early iterations, the spacing lacked consistency, and looking back, the second iteration in particular felt cluttered and less visually balanced.</p>
