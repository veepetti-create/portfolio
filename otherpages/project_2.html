                <p>For my final project, I included the character I created inside the “G” of “Bagels” at the bottom of the screen, walking toward the building. I added this element to address the sense of emptiness in the lower portion of the layout. In hindsight, I would consider either decreasing the spacing between the text or adding additional elements to enhance that area further. Additionally, I would revise the text to ensure a more cohesive appearance and maintain consistency across each paragraph.</p>

            <p>I decided not to use this design for the final project. Since the project required a two-page layout, I preferred to consolidate all the text onto one page. As I mentioned regarding the final project, I would adjust the text to be closer together or incorporate additional elements to fill the space more effectively.</p>
